# TextureChannelMixer
A simple tool to mix and match individual channels freely.
Useful for channel packing for particles/shaders

Your textures need to be imported with read/write enabled and the format set to RGBA.
The window can be opened from Window > Generation > TextureChannelCombiner
It is also recommended to make safety copies of the textures you're copying into, because corruption can happen.
